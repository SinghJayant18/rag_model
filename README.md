# RAG Model with LangChain & ChromaDB

## 📌 Introduction
This project implements a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline using **LangChain**, **ChromaDB**, and **LLMs**.  
It demonstrates how to load external data, clean and chunk it, generate embeddings, store them in a vector database, and retrieve relevant context for question answering.

The notebook is designed to run in **Google Colab** and focuses on practical RAG implementation.
